                This is my very revolutionary to do App called "help me plan". I wanted to keep it very clean and simple, because I personally feel easily overloaded with features and styles on apps that are supposed to help me structure my life in some way. I often find myself wishing apps would strip away most of their functionalities that feel useless to me, but insist on being very in my face and getting in my way so much that I can't focus on what I wanted to do anymore and get angry instead. I would have liked to make it so you can edit the individual to dos without ever leaving the list, but making them clickable and redirect to an ItemDetails page was a requirement, so I couldn't do that. My app is loosely modeled after the no-name to do app I use on my phone. You can find the link to the github repo in the footer.

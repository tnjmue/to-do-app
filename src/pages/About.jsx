            <div className="about-app">This is my very revolutionary to do App called "help me plan". I wanted to keep it very clean and simple, because I personally feel overloaded with functionalities and styles on apps that are supposed to help me plan and structure. I often find myself wishing apps would strip down on most of their features and slogans and branding. I would have liked to make it so you can edit the individual to dos without even leaving the list, but making them clickable and redirect to an ItemDetails page was a requirement, so I couldn't do that. You can fnd the link to the github repo in the footer.</div>
